-----**Installation instructions**-----  

  First you need to download the files. You can go to the [releases section of the Github page](https://github.com/MulesGaming/The-mystery-of-the-9-wands/releases), select the most resent version, and under the _assets_ section download  _The-mystery-of-the-9-wands-world.zip_. Now open the zip file. Now you need to move the *The-mystery-of-the-9-wands* folder into Minecraft's saves folder. On a windows computer you can press *Win+R* to open the run application or open it by searching. In the text box put in *%appdata%\.minecraft\saves* . You can rename *The-mystery-of-the-9-wands* to something else(Such as *The mystery of the 9 wands*) but this is not required.  
  
-----**Version Info**-----  

  The map can **theoretically** be used in any Minecraft version 1.13+ **BUT** the Map was desiged and test for versions 1.19.x and I recommend using a 19 version.

-----**Resource pack info**-----  

The Resource pack is biult in to the world files so when joining in singleplayer on 1.19.x it will load it's self. When joining on a Realm or a verion thats not a 1.19.x version you will have to install the Resource pack manualy. You can download it from releases section of the Github page( github.com/MulesGaming/The-mystery-of-the-9-wands/releases ), select the most resent version, and under the _assets_ section download and open _The-mystery-of-the-9-wands-rp.zip_. Now pause minecraft, go to Resource packs, and select open pack folder. Now drag the _The mystery of the 9 wands Resource pack_ folder into your resourse pack folder. Noow in Minecraft hover over the pack, click the play button, then done. When joining a sever you need to add the resource pack to the _server.properties file.
