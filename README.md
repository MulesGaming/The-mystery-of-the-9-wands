#-----Installation instructions-----
#Open the The-mystery-of-the-9-wands-main.zip folder and copy the  The-mystery-of-the-9-wands-main folder. Now you need to paste the folder in Minecraft's saves folder. On a windows computer you can press Win+R to open the run application or open it by searching. In the text box put in %appdata%\.minecraft\saves . In your saves folder you can now paste the folder from earlier. You can rename The-mystery-of-the-9-wands-main to something else(Such as The mystery of the 9 wands) but this is not required.
